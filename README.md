## Complete tutorial for this Gem on SitePoint - Ruby

I wrote a complete tutorial on SitePoint to cover this Gem's features in detail, if you are concerned to learn more about it just pay a visit to this [link](http://www.sitepoint.com/ratyrate-add-rating-rails-app/).

## Instructions

### Install

Add the ratyrate gem into your Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'ratyrate'
```

### Generate

```
rails g ratyrate user
```

The generator takes one argument which is the name of your existing devise user model UserModelName. This is necessary to bind the user and rating datas.
Also the generator copies necessary files (jQuery Raty plugin files, star icons and JavaScript files)

Example:

Suppose you will have a devise user model which name is User. The devise generator and ratyrate generator should be like below

```
rails g devise:install
rails g devise user

rails g ratyrate user # => user is the model generated by devise
```

This generator will create Rate and RatingCache models,
db/migrations, 
and link to your user model.

### Database Migration

Run the migrations:
```
rake db:migrate
```

### Javascript include
```
//= require jquery.raty
//= require ratyrate
```

### Prepare

I suppose you have a car model

```
rails g model car name:string
```

You should add the ratyrate_rateable function with its dimensions option. You can add multiple dimensions.

```ruby
class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
  ratyrate_rateable "speed", "engine", "price"
end
```

Then you need to add a call ratyrate_rater in the user model.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  ratyrate_rater
end
```

### Using

There is a helper method which name is rating_for to add the star links. By default rating_for will display the average rating and accept the
new rating value from authenticated user.

```erb
<%# show.html.erb -> /cars/1 %>

Speed  : <%= rating_for @car, "speed" %>
Engine : <%= rating_for @car, "engine" %>
Price  : <%= rating_for @car, "price" %>
```

### Available Options

1- If you need to change the star number, you should use star option like below.
```erb
Speed  : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :star => 10 %>
Engine : <%= rating_for @car, "engine", :star => 7 %>
Price  : <%= rating_for @car, "price" %>
```
2- If you want to disable/enable the rating after user's first rate use the new option *disable_after_rate*
```erb
Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :disable_after_rate => true %>
```
To enable changes after first user rate set ```disable_after_rate``` to false

3- To enable half stars use the option *enable_half*
```erb
Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :enable_half => true %>
```
4- To show or hide the half stars use *half_show*
```erb
Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :half_show => true %>
```
5- To change the path in which the star images (star-on.png, star-off.png, star-half.png, ..etc) are located use
```erb
Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :star_path => true %>
```

To just change one of the star images choose from these options (star_on, star_off, star_half)

6- To add the cancel button to the left, or right of the stars use **(default is false)**
```erb
Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :cancel => true %>
```
7- To change the place of the cancel button (left, or right) use **(default is left)**
```erb
Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :cancel_place => left %>
```
8- To change the hint on the cancel button use **(default is "Cancel current rating!" )**
```erb
Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :cancel_hint => "Cancel this rating!" %>
```
9- To change the image of the cancel on button use
```erb
Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :cancel_on => "cancel-on2.png" %>
```
10- To change the image of the cancel off use
```erb
  Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :cancel_off => "cancel-off2.png" %>
```
### Other Helpers

You can use the *rating_for_user* helper method to show the star rating for the user.

```erb
Speed : <%= rating_for_user @car, current_user, "speed", :star => 10 %>
```

And you can use the *imdb_style_rating_for* to show a similar to IMDB rating style.

```erb
Speed : <%= imdb_style_rating_for @car, current_user %>
```

## Semantic Versioning

Ratyrate attempts to follow semantic versioning in the format of `x.y.z`, where:

`x` stands for a major version (new features that are not backward-compatible).

`y` stands for a minor version (new features that are backward-compatible).

`z` stands for a patch (bug fixes).

In other words: `Major.Minor.Patch`.
